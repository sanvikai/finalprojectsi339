            <h2>Welcome to Worlds of Fun!</h2>
            <p>Worlds of Fun is my local theme park in Kansas City, Missouri. The park frist opened in May of 1973. It is next to its sister park, Oceans of Fun. The theme of this park is the book "Around the World in Eighty Days". It has a total of 43 attractions, with eight of them being roller coasters. It is known for its annual Halloween Haunt, which includes mazes and haunted houses, as well as Halloween alterations of the rollercoasters.  </p>

            <h2>My Experience!</h2>
            <p>
                Even though this park is my local theme park, I have only been one time. It is a standard theme park, with some very solid roller coasters. However, it is not the best place to go for those looking for a full theme park experience, and not just big thrill rides.

        <section id="rides">
            <h2>My Top 3 Rides</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>#1 Prowler:</strong> "From the moment the passengers are seat-belted into the train, the Prowler is ready to pounce. Immediately feel the power of this beast as you approach the initial hill."</li>
                <li><strong>#2 Timber Wolf:</strong> "Timber Wolf has cast an imposing shadow on the surrounding woods as Worlds of Fun's first wooden roller coaster."</li>
                <li><strong>#3 Fury of the Nile:</strong> "Relish the feeling of whitewater rafting on this raging river ride. Since its opening in 1984, riders have challenged the rapids on this dizzying water adventure."</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Food Highlights</h2>
            <li><strong>My One Food Recommendation</strong> It'a not unique to this park, and can probably be found at all of these parks but my best memory from WOF was eating Dippin Dots with my friends. </li>
