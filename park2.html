            <h2>My Experience!</h2>
            <p>
                I have been to the boardwalk three times at three vastly differnt times of my life. I've always went when visiting my aunt and uncle in the Bay Area. I've been at ages 7, 11, and 15. Each time I went, I found a new thing to be excited about. Even as someone who doesn't particulary enjoy the beach, having the boardwalk made it the perfect place to go with family, so those who do want to stay on the beach can, but those who want to go on rides can also do what they want. Overall, the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk truly does have something for everybody.

        <section id="rides">
            <h2>My Top 3 Rides</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>#1 Logger's Revenge:</strong> "Enjoy a panoramic ocean view from high above the park as you float around a watery track. Keep your eyes open for the final drop, and expect to get wet!"</li>
                <li><strong>#2 Sky Glider:</strong> "Leave the crowd behind as you glide far above the Boardwalk in a private world with incredible views. A great way to take in all the sights, sounds, and smells of our classic seaside amusement park."</li>
                <li><strong>#3 Tsunami:</strong> "With bright lights and sizzling sounds, the Tsunami is a rumbling, swirling voyage circling full speed aheadâ€“then full speed backward!"</li>
            </ul>
